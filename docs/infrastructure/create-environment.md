# Create an environment

This is the initial manual process to create a new environment like review, dev, production...

## Hub

The environment requires a shared Azure front door profile created in the hub. The service name must be declared in [the hub configuration](https://github.com/NHSDigital/dtos-hub/tree/main/infrastructure/environments). And run the Azure devops pipeline for the corresponding hub (non-live or live).

## Image Gallery

- create a new gallery in the Azure compute galleries with name nonlive_lungcs_compute_gallery
- create a resource group with name rg_hub_nonlive_lungcs_compute_gallery

## Code

- Create the configuration files in `infrastructure/environments/[environment]`
- Add the `[environment]:` target in `scripts/terraform/terraform.mk`
- Add [environment] to the list of environments in `deploy-stage` step of `cicd-2-main-branch.yaml`. For the review environment, there is a single item in `cicd-1-pull-request.yaml`.
- Set the `fetch_secrets_from_app_key_vault` terraform variable to `false`. This is to let terraform create the key vault and prevent reading before it is ready.

## Entra ID

- Create Entra ID groups in `Digital screening` Administrative Unit:
  - `postgres_lungcs_[environment]_uks_admin`
  - `screening_lungcs_[environment]`
- Ask CCOE to assign role:
  - [Form for PIM](https://nhsdigitallive.service-now.com/nhs_digital?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=28f3ab4f1bf3ca1078ac4337b04bcb78&sysparm_category=114fced51bdae1502eee65b9bd4bcbdc)
  - Approver: Add someone from the infrastructure team
  - Role Name: `Group.Read.All`
  - Application Name: `mi-lungcs-[environment]-adotoaz-uks`
  - Application ID: [client.id] (would be of `mi-lungcs-[environment]-ghtoado-uks`)
  - Managed identity: `mi-lungcs-[environment]-adotoaz-uks`
  - Description: - Managed identity: `mi-lungcs-[environment]-adotoaz-uks` - Role: permanent on Directory

## Azure Virtual Desktop Object ID

The **Azure Virtual Desktop** Service Principal Object ID must be stored in the Azure DevOps variable group:

- **Variable Group:** `<environment>_hub_backend`
- **Variable Name:** `TF_VAR_AVD_OBJECT_ID`

---

### Retrieve the Object ID

Run the following Azure CLI command:

```bash
az ad sp list --all \
  --query "[?contains(displayName,'Azure Virtual Desktop')].{Name:displayName,Id:id}" \
  -o table
```

## Bicep

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Required permissions**: Owner role on both the hub and resource subscriptions

- From AVD:
  - Login with Microsoft Graph scope: `az login --scope https://graph.microsoft.com//.default -t HSCIC365.onmicrosoft.com`
  - Run bicep: `make [environment] resource-group-init`

## Infra secrets

Add the infrastructure secrets to the _inf_ key vault `kv-lungcs-[environment]-inf`:

- For entra ID authentication (when `enable_entra_id_authentication` is true): aad-client-audiences, aad-client-id, aad-client-secret
- `monitoring-email-address`: email distribution list to receive alerts

## Azure devops

- Create ADO group
  - Name: `Run pipeline - [environment]`
  - Members: `mi-lungcs-[environment]-ghtoado-uks`. There may be more than 1 in the list. Check client id printed below the name.
  - Permissions:
    - View project-level information
- Create new pipeline:
  - Name: `Deploy to Azure - [environment]`
  - Pipeline yaml: `.azuredevops/pipelines/deploy.yml`
- Manage pipeline security:
  - Add group: `Run pipeline - [environment]`
  - Permissions:
    - Edit queue build configuration
    - Queue builds
    - View build pipeline
    - View builds
- Create service connection (ADO)
  - Connection type: `Azure Resource Manager`
  - Identity type: `Managed identity`
  - Subscription for managed identity: `Lung Cancer Risk Check - Non-live hub` or `Lung Cancer Risk Check - Live hub` for prod.
  - Resource group for managed identity: `rg-mi-[environment]-uks`
  - Managed identity: `mi-lungcs-[environment]-adotoaz-uks`
  - Scope level: `Subscription`
  - Subscription: `Digital Screening DToS - Core Services Dev`
  - Resource group for Service connection: leave blank
  - Service Connection Name: `lungcs-[environment]`
  - Do NOT tick: Grant access permission to all pipelines
  - Security: allow `Deploy to Azure - [environment]` pipeline
- Create ADO environment: [environment]
  - Set: exclusive lock (except for review)
  - Add pipeline permission for `Deploy to Azure - [environment]` pipeline

## GitHub

- Create GitHub environment [environment]
- Add the protection rule (except in review):
  - Deselect `Allow administrators to bypass configured protection rules`
  - In `Deployment branches and tags` choose `Selected branches and tags` from the drop-down menu
  - Click `Add deployment branch or tag rule` and enter "main"
- Add environment secrets, from `mi-lungcs-[environment]-ghtoado-uks` in GitHub
  - _AZURE_CLIENT_ID_
  - _AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID_

## First run

- Test running terraform manually from the AVD (Optional)
- Raise a pull request, review and merge to trigger the pipeline
- Check ADO pipeline. You may be prompted to authorise:
  - Pipeline: service connection
  - Environment: service connection and agent pool
- Assign yourself "Key Vault Secrets User" to application key vault to run the terraform code from the CLI inside the AVD when first trying to deploy the application.
- Assign yourself "Storage Blob Contributor" to State file storage account `salungcs[environment]tfstate`to run the terraform code from the CLI inside the AVD when first trying to deploy the application.

## App secrets

- Add the application secrets to the _app_ key vault `kv-lungcs-[environment]-app`
- Set `fetch_secrets_from_app_key_vault` terraform variable to `true`
- Test running terraform manually from the AVD (Optional)
- Raise a pull request, review and merge to trigger the pipeline

assign yourself "Key Vault Secrets User" to application key vault to run the terraform code from the CLI inside the AVD when first trying to deploy the application.
assign yourself "Data Blob Reader" to State file storage account to run the terraform code from the CLI inside the AVD when first trying to deploy the application.
