  <h1 class="nhsuk-heading-l">Tell us if you might have been exposed to asbestos at work</h1>

  <p>You may have been exposed to asbestos if you worked in an industry such as building or construction, particularly from the 1950s to the 1990s.</p>

  <p>You could be exposed to asbestos today if your job involves working in certain roles in old buildings.</p>

  <p>Examples include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>heating and ventilation engineers</li>
    <li>demolition workers</li>
    <li>plumbers</li>
    <li>construction workers</li>
    <li>electricians</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You may have come into contact with asbestos from existing asbestos-containing materials in buildings and products. If they are intact or undamaged, they pose very little risk.</p>

    details({
      "summaryText": "What is asbestos?",

<ul>
<li>boilers and pipes</li>
<li>car brakes</li>
<li>cement for roofing sheets</li>
<li>floor tiles</li>
<li>insulating board to protect buildings and ships against fire</li>
</ul>
<p>If you worked in an industry such as building or construction you are more likely to have come into contact with damaged asbestos materials and products.</p>"
