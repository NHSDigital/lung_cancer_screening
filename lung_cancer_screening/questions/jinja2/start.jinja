        <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">The benefits of lung cancer screening</h2>

        <p>Your risk of lung cancer increases as you get older. Screening aims to find lung cancer early, sometimes before you have symptoms. Early diagnosis can make lung cancer more treatable and make treatment more successful.</p>

        <p>You are eligible for lung cancer screening if you are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>aged between 55 and 74</li>
          <li>registered with a GP surgery</li>
          <li>someone who smokes or used to smoke</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">What to expect in the online service</h2>

        <p>We will ask you questions about:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>your height and weight</li>
          <li>your ethnicity</li>
          <li>your education</li>
          <li>if you have ever had a cancer diagnosis</li>
          <li>if your parents, siblings, or children have ever had a lung cancer diagnosis</li>
          <li>your smoking habits</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Once you have submitted your answers you will need to call us to complete the questionnaire by phone.</p>
